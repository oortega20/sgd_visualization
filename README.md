# sgd_visualization

When taking machine learning courses, I was always fascinated with gradient descent algorithms such as SGD.
I always loved the analogy of the ball moving down the hill and how this analogy can be expressed in a mathematically rigorous way using tools such as multi-variable calculus. 
I did this project simply because I like to see this analogy visually. In the future, I plan to incorporate other gradient based optimization methodologies onto this visualization project to get a comparison of their performance. 
Also, the only thing better than a ball rolling down a hill is many balls rolling down a hill :).

Enjoy,
